Keep testing out the extension with different sites to pluck out issues 
Try to get the extension to work before a user visits a page 
Try to solve pycache issue 
Try to add extra functionality like the report feature or the false report feature
Make the error messages more understandable 
Wherever youve used const get rid of it WE DONT LIKE CONST 
Refactor and organise code 
Make it so flask runs automatically once all of the above are done.
